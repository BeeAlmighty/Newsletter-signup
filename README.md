## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learnt about the importance of Javascript form validation on form elements to ensure that bugs are gotten rid of when user inputs are introduced and also best practices on form validation as well.

### Continued development

I'd like to be tested on Javascript form validation on future projects.
